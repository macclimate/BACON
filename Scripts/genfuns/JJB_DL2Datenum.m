%       This function allows for the input of time columns of Campbell Scientific dataloggers to
%       be converted into corresponding timevector number.  This function may require modification
%       to allow operation with various formats of date recording.
%
%       usage: JJB_DL2Datenum(year, month, day, hour, min, sec) outputs corresponding datenum
%       for inputted time values 
%       JJB_DL2Datenum(year, day of year, HHMM)  allows for calculation
%       of datenum using column inputs of year (YYYY), Julian day of year
%       (DDD) and 4-digit hour-minute timestamp (HHMM).
