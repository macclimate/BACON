function [Year, JD, HHMM, dt] = jjb_makedate(input_yr, min_int,format_flag)

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Takes the input year and creates three column vectors:  year, julian day
% and HHMM, for the selected minute interval
% ** minute interval must be divisable into 60 **
% File checks for a leap year and creates output file accordingly.
%
% Usage [year JD HHMM dt] = jjb_makedate(input_year, min_input,format_flag)
% format_flag = 1: last output for a given day has HHMM of 2400 of same day
% format_flag = 2: last output for a given day has HHMM of 0000 of next day
% Created May 8, 2007 by JJB
% Modified May 22, 2007 by JJB to allow for different minute intervals
% Modified May 24, 2007 by JJB to correct for first entry being 0 min into
% year. (new version starts entries at 1 interval into year).
